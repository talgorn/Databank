Getting hands dirty on Unity4.
Sound and picture assets are lived streamed from a server and spawned in a huge world, creating a 'river of data'. Assets can be clicked to get details. Live demo here: www.talgorn.me/databanks/DataBanks-Prototype.html [Unity plug-in needed. No Chrome! Might take a while to load, be patient !]
